# This test validates cross-namespace ExtAuth GatewayExtension configuration
# with ReferenceGrant enforcement at multiple attachment levels.
#
# Coverage:
# 1. Gateway-level attachment: "gateway-policy" targets the Gateway
# 2. Listener-level attachment: "listener-policy" targets listener "http2" via sectionName
# 3. HTTPRoute-level attachment (allowed): "route-allowed-policy" targets "cross-namespace-allowed"
# 4. HTTPRoute-level attachment (denied): "route-denied-policy" targets "cross-namespace-denied"
#
# All policies reference GatewayExtensions that use cross-namespace Service backendRefs:
# - "allowed-extauth-ext" in "default" namespace: Has ReferenceGrant (should succeed)
# - "denied-extauth-ext" in "denied" namespace: Missing ReferenceGrant (should fail)
#
# The test verifies that cross-namespace Service references in ExtAuth provider
# backendRefs require a ReferenceGrant, and that the translator correctly handles
# both allowed and denied cases across all attachment levels.
