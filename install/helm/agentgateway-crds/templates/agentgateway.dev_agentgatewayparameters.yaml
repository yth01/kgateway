                      with the generated configuration using **Strategic Merge Patch**
                      semantics.\n\n# Application Order\n\nOverlays are applied after
                      all typed configuration fields from both levels.\nThe full merge
                      order is:\n\n 1. GatewayClass typed configuration fields\n 2.
                      Gateway typed configuration fields\n 3. GatewayClass overlays\n
                      4. Gateway overlays (can override all previous values)\n\n#
                      Strategic Merge Patch & Deletion Guide\n\nThis merge strategy
                      allows you to override individual fields, merge lists, or delete
                      items\nwithout needing to provide the entire resource definition.\n\n**1.
                      Replacing Values (Scalars):**\nSimple fields (strings, integers,
                      booleans) in your config will overwrite the generated defaults.\n\n**2.
                      Merging Lists (Append/Merge):**\nLists with \"merge keys\" (like
                      `containers` which merges on `name`, or `tolerations` which
                      merges on `key`)\nwill append your items to the generated list,
                      or update existing items if keys match.\n\n**3. Deleting Fields
                      or List Items ($patch: delete):**\nTo remove a field or list
                      item from the generated resource, use the\n`$patch: delete`
                      directive. This works for both map fields and list items,\nand
                      is the recommended approach because it works with both client-side\nand
                      server-side apply.\n\n\tspec:\n\t  template:\n\t    spec:\n\t
                      \     # Delete pod-level securityContext\n\t      securityContext:\n\t
                      \       $patch: delete\n\t      # Delete nodeSelector\n\t      nodeSelector:\n\t
                      \       $patch: delete\n\t      containers:\n\t        # Be
                      sure to use the correct proxy name here or you will add a container
                      instead of modifying a container:\n\t        - name: proxy-name\n\t
                      \         # Delete container-level securityContext\n\t          securityContext:\n\t
                      \           $patch: delete\n\n**4. Null Values (server-side
                      apply only):**\nSetting a field to `null` can also remove it,
                      but this ONLY works with\n`kubectl apply --server-side` or equivalent.
                      With regular client-side\n`kubectl apply`, null values are stripped
                      by kubectl before reaching\nthe API server, so the deletion
                      won't occur. Prefer `$patch: delete`\nfor consistent behavior
                      across both apply modes.\n\n\tspec:\n\t  template:\n\t    spec:\n\t
                      \     nodeSelector: null  # Removes nodeSelector (server-side
                      apply only!)\n\n**5. Replacing Maps Entirely ($patch: replace):**\nTo
                      replace an entire map with your values (instead of merging),
                      use `$patch: replace`.\nThis removes all existing keys and replaces
                      them with only your specified keys.\n\n\tspec:\n\t  template:\n\t
                      \   spec:\n\t      nodeSelector:\n\t        $patch: replace\n\t
                      \       custom-key: custom-value\n\n**6. Replacing Lists Entirely
                      ($patch: replace):**\nIf you want to strictly define a list
                      and ignore all generated defaults, use `$patch: replace`.\n\n\tservice:\n\t
                      \ spec:\n\t    ports:\n\t      - $patch: replace\n\t      -

                      with the generated configuration using **Strategic Merge Patch**
                      semantics.\n\n# Application Order\n\nOverlays are applied after
                      all typed configuration fields from both levels.\nThe full merge
                      order is:\n\n 1. GatewayClass typed configuration fields\n 2.
                      Gateway typed configuration fields\n 3. GatewayClass overlays\n
                      4. Gateway overlays (can override all previous values)\n\n#
                      Strategic Merge Patch & Deletion Guide\n\nThis merge strategy
                      allows you to override individual fields, merge lists, or delete
                      items\nwithout needing to provide the entire resource definition.\n\n**1.
                      Replacing Values (Scalars):**\nSimple fields (strings, integers,
                      booleans) in your config will overwrite the generated defaults.\n\n**2.
                      Merging Lists (Append/Merge):**\nLists with \"merge keys\" (like
                      `containers` which merges on `name`, or `tolerations` which
                      merges on `key`)\nwill append your items to the generated list,
                      or update existing items if keys match.\n\n**3. Deleting Fields
                      or List Items ($patch: delete):**\nTo remove a field or list
                      item from the generated resource, use the\n`$patch: delete`
                      directive. This works for both map fields and list items,\nand
                      is the recommended approach because it works with both client-side\nand
                      server-side apply.\n\n\tspec:\n\t  template:\n\t    spec:\n\t
                      \     # Delete pod-level securityContext\n\t      securityContext:\n\t
                      \       $patch: delete\n\t      # Delete nodeSelector\n\t      nodeSelector:\n\t
                      \       $patch: delete\n\t      containers:\n\t        # Be
                      sure to use the correct proxy name here or you will add a container
                      instead of modifying a container:\n\t        - name: proxy-name\n\t
                      \         # Delete container-level securityContext\n\t          securityContext:\n\t
                      \           $patch: delete\n\n**4. Null Values (server-side
                      apply only):**\nSetting a field to `null` can also remove it,
                      but this ONLY works with\n`kubectl apply --server-side` or equivalent.
                      With regular client-side\n`kubectl apply`, null values are stripped
                      by kubectl before reaching\nthe API server, so the deletion
                      won't occur. Prefer `$patch: delete`\nfor consistent behavior
                      across both apply modes.\n\n\tspec:\n\t  template:\n\t    spec:\n\t
                      \     nodeSelector: null  # Removes nodeSelector (server-side
                      apply only!)\n\n**5. Replacing Maps Entirely ($patch: replace):**\nTo
                      replace an entire map with your values (instead of merging),
                      use `$patch: replace`.\nThis removes all existing keys and replaces
                      them with only your specified keys.\n\n\tspec:\n\t  template:\n\t
                      \   spec:\n\t      nodeSelector:\n\t        $patch: replace\n\t
                      \       custom-key: custom-value\n\n**6. Replacing Lists Entirely
                      ($patch: replace):**\nIf you want to strictly define a list
                      and ignore all generated defaults, use `$patch: replace`.\n\n\tservice:\n\t
                      \ spec:\n\t    ports:\n\t      - $patch: replace\n\t      -

                      or List Items ($patch: delete):**\nTo remove a field or list
                      item from the generated resource, use the\n`$patch: delete`
                      directive. This works for both map fields and list items,\nand
                      is the recommended approach because it works with both client-side\nand

                      use `$patch: replace`.\nThis removes all existing keys and replaces

                          (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers
                          and services.

                    description: "Spec provides an opaque mechanism to configure the
                      resource Spec.\nThis field accepts a complete or partial Kubernetes
                      resource spec (e.g., PodSpec, ServiceSpec)\nand will be merged
                      with the generated configuration using **Strategic Merge Patch**
                      semantics.\n\n# Application Order\n\nOverlays are applied after
                      all typed configuration fields from both levels.\nThe full merge
                      order is:\n\n 1. GatewayClass typed configuration fields\n 2.
                      Gateway typed configuration fields\n 3. GatewayClass overlays\n
                      4. Gateway overlays (can override all previous values)\n\n#
                      Strategic Merge Patch & Deletion Guide\n\nThis merge strategy
                      allows you to override individual fields, merge lists, or delete
                      items\nwithout needing to provide the entire resource definition.\n\n**1.
                      Replacing Values (Scalars):**\nSimple fields (strings, integers,
                      booleans) in your config will overwrite the generated defaults.\n\n**2.
                      Merging Lists (Append/Merge):**\nLists with \"merge keys\" (like
                      `containers` which merges on `name`, or `tolerations` which
                      merges on `key`)\nwill append your items to the generated list,
                      or update existing items if keys match.\n\n**3. Deleting Fields
                      or List Items ($patch: delete):**\nTo remove a field or list
                      item from the generated resource, use the\n`$patch: delete`
                      directive. This works for both map fields and list items,\nand
                      is the recommended approach because it works with both client-side\nand
                      server-side apply.\n\n\tspec:\n\t  template:\n\t    spec:\n\t
                      \     # Delete pod-level securityContext\n\t      securityContext:\n\t
                      \       $patch: delete\n\t      # Delete nodeSelector\n\t      nodeSelector:\n\t
                      \       $patch: delete\n\t      containers:\n\t        # Be
                      sure to use the correct proxy name here or you will add a container
                      instead of modifying a container:\n\t        - name: proxy-name\n\t
                      \         # Delete container-level securityContext\n\t          securityContext:\n\t
                      \           $patch: delete\n\n**4. Null Values (server-side
                      apply only):**\nSetting a field to `null` can also remove it,
                      but this ONLY works with\n`kubectl apply --server-side` or equivalent.
                      With regular client-side\n`kubectl apply`, null values are stripped
                      by kubectl before reaching\nthe API server, so the deletion
                      won't occur. Prefer `$patch: delete`\nfor consistent behavior
                      across both apply modes.\n\n\tspec:\n\t  template:\n\t    spec:\n\t
                      \     nodeSelector: null  # Removes nodeSelector (server-side
                      apply only!)\n\n**5. Replacing Maps Entirely ($patch: replace):**\nTo
                      replace an entire map with your values (instead of merging),
                      use `$patch: replace`.\nThis removes all existing keys and replaces
                      them with only your specified keys.\n\n\tspec:\n\t  template:\n\t
                      \   spec:\n\t      nodeSelector:\n\t        $patch: replace\n\t
                      \       custom-key: custom-value\n\n**6. Replacing Lists Entirely
                      ($patch: replace):**\nIf you want to strictly define a list
                      and ignore all generated defaults, use `$patch: replace`.\n\n\tservice:\n\t
                      \ spec:\n\t    ports:\n\t      - $patch: replace\n\t      -
                      name: http\n\t        port: 80\n\t        targetPort: 8080\n\t
                      \       protocol: TCP\n\t      - name: https\n\t        port:
                      443\n\t        targetPort: 8443\n\t        protocol: TCP"
