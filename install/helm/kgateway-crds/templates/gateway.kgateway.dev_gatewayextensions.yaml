                              BackendRefs list). For non-zero values, there may be some epsilon from
                              the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
                              implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
                              weights does not need to equal 100.

                              If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                              of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
                              traffic should be forwarded for this entry. If unspecified, weight

                              the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
                              implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
                              weights does not need to equal 100.

                              If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                              of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
                              traffic should be forwarded for this entry. If unspecified, weight
